# IE-AutoSpriter-
Infinity Engine AutoSpriter is a Blender add-on that automates sprite creation from creature animations.

This is a work in progress and an alpha release. This means that most things are not implemented and the mod is subject to heavy changes. Use this mod with caution!!

This is also a learning project focused on my personal use. Suggestions are welcome!

Alpha Version:
* May not work or only work under special conditions.
* The script has been tested, but not as an add-on.
* May not work due to missing information in the manual.
* Performance intensive (current). Rendering a frame took 3 to 4 seconds. In one case, the performance outlier was 15 seconds for rendering a frame.
* May contain issues for various reasons.
* I am not a Blender or Blender API expert, so this may also cause issues.
