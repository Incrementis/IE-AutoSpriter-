# IE-AutoSpriter-
Infinity Engine AutoSpriter is a Blender add-on that automates sprite creation from creature animations.

This is a work in progress and an alpha release. This means that most things are not implemented and the add-on is subject to heavy changes. Use this add-on with caution!!

This is also a learning project focused on my personal use. Suggestions are welcome!

## Alpha Version:
* May not work or only work under special conditions.
* May not work due to missing information in the manual.
* May contain issues for various reasons.
* I am not a Blender or Blender API expert, so this may also cause issues.
* Only Tested it with blender version 4.0(It may already work on higher versions)
### Performance
The 4.0 blend save files contain the appropriate settings.
#### Render engine "Cycles": 
* Rendering a frame took [0.8 to 1 seconds](https://github.com/Incrementis/IE-AutoSpriter-/issues/18#issuecomment-3079607164)
#### Render engine "EEVEE": 
* Rendering a frame took [0.05 seconds](https://github.com/Incrementis/IE-AutoSpriter-/issues/18#issuecomment-3079719096)
